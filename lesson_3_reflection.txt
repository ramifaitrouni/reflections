When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I may do that to access my work from another computer later if I change location
    or if I need the work to be shared with others.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This may be better in cases where others commits on the remote and I don't
    want their changes on my local repositary yet.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are copies of repository on gitHub servers , clones are copies
    of local or remote repositories on local computer and branches are just
    copies of commits in the same local repositary.
    I use fork when I want to create a remote copy to use someone's work 
    and change it, clone to get a local full copy of a repositary to work on, 
    branch to get a copy of a commit so I can change it in the same repositary 
    to obtain a different version of the work without touching the original version. 



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
